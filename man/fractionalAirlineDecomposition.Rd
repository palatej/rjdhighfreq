\usage{
fractionalAirlineDecomposition(y, period, adjust = T, sn = F, stde = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{}

\item{period}{Period of the seasonal component}

\item{adjust}{True if an actual fractional airline model is used. False if the period is rounded to the nearest integer}

\item{sn}{Signal/noise decomposition. The signal is the seasonally adjusted series and the noise the seasonal component}

\item{stde}{True if standard deviations of the components must be computed. In some cases (memory limits), it is currently not possible to compute them}
